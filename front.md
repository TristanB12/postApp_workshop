# PostApp Workshop - front end

The goal of this workshop is to introduce you to front-end developpement with Vue.js and HTML/CSS.

## Step 0: Installation

First, create a new github repository and clone it into your computer.

Secondly, make sure you have node.js installed. If not you can install it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#centos-fedora-and-red-hat-enterprise-linux).

Then we need to [install](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html) vue-cli to config and manage easily our project.
After it is installed you can create a new vue project with `vue create front`, it will create a `front` directory with all the files you need.

You are now invited to select projects settings: use **arrow keys** to navigate, **enter** to go to next step and **space** to select/unselect.
 - choose `Manually select features`
 - select `Router`, `CSS Pre-procesors` and unselect `Linter / formatter`
 - say Yes to Use history mode for router
 - choose `Sass/SCSS (with node-sass)`
 - choose `In dedicated config files`
 - and finnaly say No to Save this as a preset for future projects
