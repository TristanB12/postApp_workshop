# postApp_workshop

The aim of this workshop is to introduce you at fullstack developpement. You will learn how to do a postApp with:
  - a full authentication system (with login and sign up modules)
  - an 'add post' option wich permit you to add a post in the app
  - a 'feed' pannel where you can see other posts
  
 By implementing these features you will learn:
  - Vue.js
  - HTML/CSS
  - Express
  - Node.js
  - mongoose (mongoDB)
  - components developpement
  - http requests
  
  First, you will need to follow the installations steps detailed [here](https://github.com/TristanB12/postApp_workshop/blob/master/Installations.md).
  Then you can jump into the workshop by starting with front-end. After you finished this first part, you can continue with back-end.
  
  You can check out the [source code](https://github.com/TristanB12/postApp_workshop/tree/master/source_code) from the postApp I wrote if you're having trouble but try to figure it out instead of just copy and paste.
